This code, which can be found in [this repository](https://osf.io/8atfn/overview), utilizes the embedding space created with latent semantic analysis to calculate the similarity between adjacent words and utterances in a transcript. This requires the transcripts to be segmented such that each word is on a separate line, and indices indicate the story number."
