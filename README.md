# LING 430 Final Project
This repository contains the narrative discourse data, coherence scores, and scripts for the LING 430 (Computational Linguistics) final project. The project aims to utilize computational linguistic techniques (i.e., microlinguistic and macrolinguistic feature derivation) and simple machine learning to predict coherence scores for narrative discourse transcripts in a manner that correlates with human assessments.
