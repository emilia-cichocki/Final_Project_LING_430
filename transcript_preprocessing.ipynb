    "# Transcript Processing\n",
    "This notebook completes a variety of pre-processing steps for the narrative transcripts collected from the [HANNA](https://github.com/dig-team/hanna-benchmark-asg/blob/main/README.md) and [CoheSentia](https://github.com/AviyaMn/CoheSentia/blob/main/README.md) corpuses. The HANNA corpus contains 1,056 human or large-language model (LLM) generated stories to given prompts, each of which is scored by three human raters for coherence. The CoheSentia corpus contains 500 stories generated by GPT-3 and scored by seven human raters for global coherence, with a holistic score provided as a combination of ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with the instructions provided to human scorers, this notebook truncates transcripts to the last full utterance ([Chhun et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11646)). Additionally, it calculates single coherence scores by averaging the ratings of multiple scorers, and ensures that all scores are on a 1 - 5 scale. Finally, it creates a single DataFrame containing combined transcripts from both corpuses and their corresponding coherence scores."
